.
introduction:
Artists have long dreamed of a tool that would enable them to realize their creative ideas with greater accuracy and ease. Therefore, the smart drawing machine becomes an ideal solution to achieve this dream, relying on modern technologies that ensure accurate drawing and automatically change the colors of the pens according to the desired design.
A machine for drawing with pens and changing the pens alone according to the appropriate color automatically:
This project offers an innovative solution for drawing enthusiasts, based on a smart machine capable of drawing any design with high accuracy and automatically changing the colors of the pens according to the desired design.
System components:
• Electronic Controller (Arduino): Used to control the operation of all components of the system.
• Robotic arm: used to draw the design on paper.
• Stepper motor: used to move the robotic arm with high precision.
• Pen holder: used to hold colored pencils.
• Color sensor: used to measure the color of the pen in the pen holder.
• Pen selection unit: used to select the appropriate color pen for drawing.
• Drawing software: Used to design drawings and send them to the electronic control unit.
How the system works:
1. Design submission: The required design is sent to the electronic control unit through drawing software.
2. Design analysis: The electronic control unit analyzes the design and determines the pen colors needed for drawing.
3. Pen selection: The pen selection unit selects the pen of the appropriate color for drawing from the pen holder.
4. Controlling the robotic arm: The electronic control unit sends signals to the linear actuator to control the movement of the robotic arm and draw the design on paper.
5. Changing pens: If the color of the design changes, the pen selection unit selects the new color pen from the pen holder, and the electronic control unit sends a signal to the linear actuator to move the robotic arm to the pen holder to change the pen.
6. Continue drawing: The robotic arm continues drawing until the entire design is completed.
System features:
• Drawing accuracy: The system is characterized by high drawing accuracy, which allows complex designs to be drawn with great accuracy.
• Ease of use: The system is easy to use, and does not require prior technical experience.
• Saving time and effort: The system contributes to saving the time and effort spent on drawing manually.
• Creativity without limits: The system allows users to embody their creative ideas without restrictions, as they can draw any design they want.
Applications:
• Artists: The system is used by professional artists to increase the accuracy of their artwork and save time and effort.
• Designers: The system is used by designers to create illustrations and graphic designs with high accuracy.
• Students: The system is used by students in schools and universities to learn drawing skills and develop their creative abilities.
• Manufacturers: The system is used in factories to create labels on products with high accuracy.
Conclusion:
The project of a drawing machine with pens that automatically changes pens alone according to the appropriate color is an innovative solution that provides a distinguished service to drawing lovers, as it allows them to draw any design with high accuracy and complete ease. The system is easy to use and highly efficient, making it an ideal choice for use in various applications.
